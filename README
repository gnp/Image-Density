Image::Density version 0.3

A trivial density calculation would count the number of black pixels and
divide by the total number of pixels. However, it would produce
misleading results in the case where the image contains one or more
target areas with scanned content and large blank areas in between
(imagine a photocopy of a driver's license in the middle of a page).

The metric implemented here estimates the density of data where there
*is* data, and has a reasonable correlation with goodness as judged by
humans. That is, if you let a human look at a set of images and judge
quality, the density values for those images as calculated here tend to
correlate well with the human judgement (densities that are too high or
too low represent "bad" images).

This algorithm is intended for use on bitonal TIFF images, such as those
from scanning paper documents.
